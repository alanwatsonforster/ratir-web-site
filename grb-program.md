# RATIR: GRB Program

*Note: RATIR was removed from the telescope in June 2022.*

<hr/>

RATIR has an observational program directed at observations of GRBs and associated phenomena. 

Initial results are typically published as GCN Circulars, with more refereed publications following later.

We are open to collaboration on refereed publications, especially with groups that have complementary data. To explore this possibility, please contact Nat Butler (<a href="mailto:nat.butler@asu.edu">nat.butler@asu.edu</a>).

The RATIR GRB team consists of:

* Joshua Bloom
* Nathanial Butler (principal investigator)
* Xavier Prochaska
* Enrico Ramirez‐Ruiz
* Jesús González
* William Lee
* Michael Richer
* Carlos Román
* Alan Watson
* Alexander S. Kutyrev

Team members have the right to be co-authors of any article that
directly uses RATIR data taken as part of the RATIR GRB program.
